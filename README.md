### Hello! 🐣

I'm Felicia. A Front End Developer student at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm.  
So far, I've acquired solid understanding of HTML, CSS/SCSS and JavaScript/TypeScript.  
Over the next couple of months, I will expand my skillset to include working with Vue and React. 💥

Right now I'm in the process of finding the perfect match for my first internship between september 25th and december 3rd.   
Portfolio is still a lil work in progress (what isn't?), but have a look: https://feliciacalming.se
